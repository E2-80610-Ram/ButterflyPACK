\hypertarget{C_Interface_autotoc_md36}{}\doxysubsection{C Interface}\label{C_Interface_autotoc_md36}
The C interface is defined in the header file Strumpack\+Sparse\+Solver.\+h and is very similar to the C++ interface. For example usage see the programs sexample.\+c, dexample.\+c, cexample.\+c and zexample.\+c in the examples/sparse/ directory, for simple single and double precision real and complex example programs. Note that since the STRUMPACK code is written in C++, even when using the C interface you should link with a C++ aware linker or link with the standard C++ library. For instance when using the GNU toolchain, link with g++ instead of gcc or link with gcc and include -\/lstdc++.\hypertarget{C_Interface_autotoc_md37}{}\doxysubsection{Fortran Interface}\label{C_Interface_autotoc_md37}
A fortran module file is installed in the include folder under the CMAKE\+\_\+\+INSTALL\+\_\+\+PREFIX directory. The use of this Fortran interface is illustrated in examples/sparse/fexample.\+f90, in the examples folder. The fortran module is build from the src/fortran/fortran.\+f90 file, which is generated from the C interface in src/\+Strumpack\+Sparse\+Solver.\+h.

To use the STRUMPACK Fortran interface and link to the Fortran library in an application, we recommend CMake. An example CMake project looks like\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake\_minimum\_required(VERSION 3.13)}
\DoxyCodeLine{project(fexample VERSION 0.1 LANGUAGES Fortran)}
\DoxyCodeLine{find\_package(STRUMPACK REQUIRED)}
\DoxyCodeLine{add\_executable(fexample fexample.f90)}
\DoxyCodeLine{target\_link\_libraries(fexample PRIVATE STRUMPACK::strumpack)}

\end{DoxyCode}


And then invoke CMake with the path to the STRUMPACK installation folder set\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{> export STRUMPACK\_DIR=/some/path/STRUMPACK/install}
\DoxyCodeLine{> cd myapp}
\DoxyCodeLine{> mkdir build}
\DoxyCodeLine{> cd build}
\DoxyCodeLine{> cmake ../}
\DoxyCodeLine{> make}

\end{DoxyCode}
