/*! \mainpage Overview

ButterflyPACK is a mathematical software for rapidly solving large-scale dense linear systems that exhibit off-diagonal rank-deficiency. 
These systems arise frequently from boundary element methods, or factorization phases in finite-difference/finite-element methods. 
ButterflyPACK relies on low-rank or butterfly formats under Hierarchical matrix, HODLR or other hierarchically nested frameworks to compress, factor and solve the linear system in quasi-linear time. 
The computationally most intensive phase, factorization, is accelerated via randomized linear algebras. 
The butterfly format, originally inspired by the butterfly data flow in fast Fourier Transform, is a linear algebra tool well-suited for compressing matrices arising from high-frequency wave equations or highly oscillatory integral operators. 
ButterflyPACK also provides preconditioned TFQMR iterative solvers.

ButterflyPACK is written in Fortran 2003, it also has C++ interfaces. ButterflyPACK supports hybrid MPI/OpenMP programming models. 
In addition, ButterflyPACK can be readily invoked from the software STRUMPACK for solving dense and sparse linear systems.
