This directory contains sample programs to illustrate how to call functions in ButterflyPACK from your application code. ButterflyPACK provide both double and double-complex data types in two indepdent libraries. As such, all ButterflyPACK modules, subroutines, functions and derived types are named with the prefix "x_". x=d for double precision and x=z for double complex precision. ButterflyPACK provides both Fortran and C/C++ interfaces.   

## Fortran Example
A hierarchical matrix can be constructed by the following two ways. (a) call
